            Diya is fourteen years old and has been drawing and painting since she was three. When she was eight years
            old, her mom encouraged Diya and her brother to make some art and sell it for charity. They donated the
            money to the Seattle Children's Hospital. When she found out about Pencils of Promise, a non-profit
            organization that builds schools in Laos, Ghana, and Guatemala, she wanted to join the cause.
            Many children around the world do not have access to education. If those children were educated, they would
            have the ability to bring their families out of poverty. It can lift communities. Each school-building
            project by Pencils of Promise is headed by someone local to the community. 20% of the work going into
            building and starting these schools have to be done by the people who live in the town where the school will
            be built, to ensure that the town is invested in the school and will use it. Diya would like to fund an
            entire school for Pencils of Promise by donating all the money she makes from art commissions. Her parents
            are going to match what she raises to help her meet her goal.
